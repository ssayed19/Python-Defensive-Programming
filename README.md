This repository contains various exercise files from Defensive Programming that I have created to demonstrate my knowledge

# Description
inputvalidation.py - Checks that the input values 3 or 7 are entered, cancels all other incorrect values, this was to test input validation

SHA1Hashexample.py - Takes an inputed message, encrypts it using SHA-1, shows the hash, and then decrypts it back

coinchange_w_errortraps - Takes input number of coins and returns the total, another example of input validation

tempexample.py - Another input validation example where an input temperature in celsius is taken and then converted to fahrenheit.
